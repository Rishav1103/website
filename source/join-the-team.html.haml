        %span Since we started in early 2013 we've grown from two people to a team of 20.
        We've graduated more than #{stats.number_of_graduates} Junior Developers, who now work at places like Pivotal Labs, 8th Light, ThoughtWorks, New Bamboo, BSkyB, FundingCircle, the Ministry of Justice, Venntro, Mint Digital and many other great companies. We're profitable. Our mission is to teach as many people as possible to code well through our web development coding classes.

      %p To know, write.
      %p To master, coach.
