      we’ve got table tennis, yoga, discussion groups, excessive N64 gaming, and the odd NERF battle. These kinds of activities are designed to keep your brain alive and your motivation intact. Of course, there's also an enormous amount of coding. While no two days are identical, here's a general sense of what an average day might look like:

%section.no-padding-top
  .container
    .centered-row
      %table.responsive-table
        %thead
          %tr
            %th Time
            %th Activity
            %th Description
        %tbody
          %tr
            %td{data:{header: "Time"}} 10.00am
            %td{data:{header: "Activity"}} Skills Workshop
            %td{data:{header: "Description"}}
              %p Students are introduced to key programming skills in isolation, and then given room to practice and feed back in a group setting. This is a chance to have a coach demo some stuff, or visualise things using a board.
          %tr
            %td{data:{header: "Time"}} 11.00am
            %td{data:{header: "Activity"}} Pair Programming
            %td{data:{header: "Description"}}
              %p Students pair with each other throughout the morning, building real stuff using tools and practices we’d expect from a professional junior developer.
          %tr
            %td{data:{header: "Time"}} 12.30pm
            %td{data:{header: "Activity"}} Lunch
            %td{data:{header: "Description"}}
              %p Our cohorts tend to lunch together. Generally they like to go out in droves to one of Shoreditch’s fine local eateries and there's often a lunchtime talk from one of the many CTOs that our hiring team speak to!
          %tr
            %td{data:{header: "Time"}} 1.30pm
            %td{data:{header: "Activity"}} Meditation
            %td{data:{header: "Description"}}
              %p Programming is extremely challenging. Meditation helps keep a lid on things, keeps you grounded, and helps keep your brain sharp.
          %tr
            %td{data:{header: "Time"}} 2.00pm
            %td{data:{header: "Activity"}} Pair Programming
            %td{data:{header: "Description"}}
              %p The afternoon is spent pair programming, as students work through the challenges or projects provided in the curriculum.
          %tr
            %td{data:{header: "Time"}} 7.00pm
            %td{data:{header: "Activity"}} Socialising
            %td{data:{header: "Description"}}
              %p A pecha kucha night, a trip to a software craftsmanship meetup at Yammer, a hosted event, or a film night...we love to organise stuff to keep our students social bar topped up.
