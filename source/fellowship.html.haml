      %h3 Why are you doing this?
      %p As we approach our 5th birthday, and circle our 1500th student, it’s time to start putting our money where our collective mouth is. We’re big believers in doing our bit to improve the diversity of the tech community, but that can sometimes feel a little bit hollow when the course is only accessible to those with £8k to spare. In reality, there are lots of smart people out there who don’t have £8k lying around. To all of those people we say - (APPLY NOW)[link to apply], we believe in you! You have greatness within you... Money should never be a barrier to achieving your dreams.
