      %h2 Get a job at ThoughtWorks
      %p After completing the Makers Academy course, scholars will potentially be offered a position at ThoughtWorks. A core part of your experience as an entry-level consultant in any of our global offices is spending five weeks at ThoughtWorks University in India, with ThoughtWorkers from all over the world, discovering the values, practices and principles that have made ThoughtWorks successful. TWU is an intensive, hands-on experience, where youâ€™ll learn how to build working software from week one. By the end of the program, you'll have real experience and a global community of support.
