      %h4.subheader A self-service hiring platform<br>only for small businesses*
      %p We've been helping large companies hire our developers for many years. However, not all companies can afford our entire suite of services, so we've created this new platform as a means to help smaller employers like you get access to our amazing software developers.
      %p This means you won't get the same service, but you also won't be paying the same price.

        %p You have to be amazing to study at Makers Academy. We have a tough selection process, which tests for determination and technical aptitude, and accepts less than 10% of applicants. We find exceptional people for you, and then train them.
      .column

        %p Our students spend 10-14 hours a day, 5-7 days a week, learning to be developers. They're mostly career-changers and know what working hard is: the kind of developers a startup or growing company needs.
      .column
        %h5 Consistently brilliant
        %p The only people who will see your job will be super-smart, super-driven Makers Academy developers. The ratio of high-quality, brilliant people is much higher than any other source of talent.

        %p We're allowing you to put your company in front of the best junior developers looking for work right now
        %p It's a closed, private platform, only accessible to the developers who have completed the course and are actively job-hunting. They've spent a lot of time and money learning to code, so are therefore extremely eager to start working as soon as possible. It's not hit-and-miss like other job platforms - you know you'll only receive applications from the kind of developers we train.

          %p Makers Academy developers are passionate, driven, curious and engaged.
          %p They solve their own problems, are exceptionally fast and effective learners, and understand the business context beyond the code.
          %p The majority of our graduates have been successful in another industry, including law, marketing, banking, design, and many more: that's experience they'll bring to your company.

      .column
        %h4 Where are they based?
        %p Our software developers are mostly in London and Manchester, with many in other UK cities and parts of Europe and USA. However, we’re growing fast and would love to chat about your location.
