        <article>
          <dl>
            <dt>What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?</dt>
            <dd><p>I was a full time Mum for 7 years and before that I had my own franchise business.</p></dd>
            <dt>What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?</dt>
            <dd><p>I've always loved tech and I was curious about code. A friend of mine said I should consider doing it as a career.</p></dd>
            <dt>How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?</dt>
            <dd><p>I came across Makers Academy through a bootcamp review website. I was deciding between Makers and GA. GA felt too international and a numbers game. Makers on the other hand felt non-salesy and genuine and I liked that.</p></dd>
            <dt>What did you find difficult during the course?</dt>
            <dd><p>I had a lot of guilt as my mind was on the course so much that I didn't get to spend much quality time with my children, and any spare time I had I spent it coding. I also had to keep pushing through the times where I felt so stupid.</p></dd>
            <dt>What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?</dt>
            <dd><p>I carried on working on my code. Mergermarket was my 7th interview. It was difficult as I wanted to always do more but being a Mum I chose to spend more time with the kids, and that slowed my progress. I also needed to build my confidence. So it took a while. I had a lot of disappointing interviews, I'd give myself a few days and go back to coding and I kept attending Makers and got lots of support which is very special.</p></dd>
            <dt>How has your life changed since graduation?</dt>
            <dd><p>I feel much more confident. I'm more confident as a developer and I got a job! My family is just so proud of me.</p></dd>
            <dt>What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?</dt>
            <dd><p>That everything you do is a risk. Life is full of risks and this is no different. This industry is not going anywhere and it is recession-proof. Job-wise you will be able to get a job at the end of the day, and if you love code there is no reason not to.</p></dd>
            <dt>What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?</dt>
            <dd><p>It's an investment in yourself and to be honest, it's quite cheap in the long run. It's not about the cash but it's also about you as a person and you are gaining a skill that will be useful for at least another 40 or so years. It's a bargain.</p></dd>
            <dt>What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?</dt>
            <dd><p>My biggest worry was that I wouldn't get a job, and up until last week that is how I felt, but I got a job! I was also worried if I was too old to change careers, and yes it took a long time, but I got a job and no, I was not too old. I kept at it and got lots of encouragement from the Makers Academy team.</p></dd>
            <dt>Sum up your Makers Academy experience</dt>
            <dd><p>Probably the best experience of my life!</p></dd>
            <dt>What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?</dt>
            <dd><p>Be comfortable in people seeing your code. Test-drive your code and be yourself. One of my friends, Dave, from my cohort said, "Just relax and remember how much you love coding."</p></dd>
