- title: Precourse
  summary: Everything you need to get ready for the main course
  image: precourse.png
  blurb: "In the four weeks preceding the full-time course, all students are required to complete a (very important!) part-time PreCourse, which ensures that all of our students get to the required basic level of competence when they enrol at Makers Academy. In the first week, we focus on the foundations: first, the command-line, which is key to navigating around your computer; second, you'll tackle version control using Git and Github. This is followed by learning Ruby syntax through challenges. The PreCourse requires at least 20 hours per week to complete successfully, but the more time you can spend on the PreCourse, the better."

  summary: Test-Driven Development and Object-Oriented Programming
  blurb: "The main topics of week 1 are test-driven development and object-oriented programming. By now, students have some experience writing pure Ruby code and are familiar with the functionality of core Ruby classes. This week we start creating our own classes in a test-driven way. The aim of this week is to understand how to structure code using objects. This weekend, students will attempt their first weekend challenge. Weekend challenges are completed each week to reflect and consolidate the learning from the previous week."

  summary: Further TDD and OOP
  blurb: "This week we delve into more complex test-driven development and object-oriented programming to make sure students understand these important concepts well." 

- title: Week 3

  summary: Introduction to Web Development
  blurb: "By now, students are comfortable using Ruby and writing object-oriented code in a test-driven way. In week 3 we focus on the fundamentals of the web: HTTP protocols, the Sinatra framework, HTML & CSS. We also learn how to deploy our code to Heroku and use the development tools in Chrome. Finally, students also learn how to use Capybara to test-drive web applications. This week is a favourites amongst students, as they are finally able to deploy a working application to the web."

- title: Week 4
  image: db.png
  summary: Databases and User Management
  blurb: "It's time to learn how to add a relational database to a Sinatra application using DataMapper. In this week we talk about relational databases, key-value stores and SQL. We also spend a lot of time discussing proper management of user accounts: hashing and salting, choosing appropriate hashing algorithms and mitigating common security risks. Students write a user management system (sign up, sign in, sign out, etc) from scratch, paying special attention to the security aspects. This is an important milestone as students now have a full picture of web development."

- title: Week 5
  image: js.png
  summary: Front-End Technologies
  blurb: "Now that students can build test-driven, secure, database-backed web applications, it's time to start talking about front-end technologies: JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX and responsive design. Students begin learning their second language: JavaScript, also known as the language of the web."

- title: Week 6
  image: lab.png
  summary: Project week 1
  blurb: "This week is all about teamwork as students are introduced to some techniques and practices common in an Agile or XP workplace. Working on a set project in small groups, students will learn Git workflow, QA, Standups/Scrums, Kanban and Pair Programming in a team environment. This is also a great opportunity to practice and consolidate the skills and concepts learned in previous weeks."

- title: Week 7
  image: advanced-js.png
  summary: Further JavaScript
  blurb: "Students expand their knowledge of JavaScript by building a single page application in pure JavaScript - no frameworks allowed! Students will demystify the inner workings of JS frameworks as they build everything from the testing platform to the front end architecture of their application in pure JavaScript."

- title: Week 8
  image: rails.png
  summary: Ruby on Rails Basics
  blurb: "In week 8 we start working with Ruby on Rails. By now students have a solid understanding of Ruby, the web (HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, etc) and have experience using databases. Armed with all this knowledge, they find Rails easy to understand as it merely automates what they can do without it. This week we talk about ActiveRecord, the asset pipeline, routing and Rails architecture."

- title: Week 9
  image: advanced-rails.png
  summary: Project Week 2
  blurb: "This week we consolidate our learning by building a full-stack project using everything we've learnt from the previous weeks. Agile, Git workflow, User Stories, and teamwork are revisited in another team based project."

- title: Week 10
  summary: Individual Technical Challenges
  blurb: "This week we get back to pure Object Oriented Design with a series of individual challenges designed to stretch students' understanding of OOD principles such as SOLID. This week will reinforce behaviours like testing first, using enough design upfront and applying XP values to your code. The challenges this week will be undertaken individually, and are designed to mimic technical tests commonly used by employers as part of the recruitment process."
  
- title: Week 11
  image: final-projects.png
  summary: The Final Project
  blurb: "By now students are confident Junior Developers. To put their skills to the test, they build a final project that shows how far they've come since they started. This week we introduce fewer new topics and instead focus on helping students to build the first version of their final project."

- title: Week 12
  image: graduation.png
  summary: Graduation
  blurb: "Early in the week we declare a feature freeze to make sure the final projects are as polished as possible. This is the most intensive week at Makers Academy, when all teams stay late trying to outperform each other to write the most impressive code. There is no Friday challenge. Instead, we have a graduation ceremony, followed by a party attended by friends, families, hiring partners, recruiters, ex-students and prospective students of Makers Academy."
